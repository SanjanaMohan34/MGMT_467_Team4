    After completing analysis of the bar chart for Hypothesis A, Subscriber trips were significantly shorter than Customer trips on average. It seems that CitiBike was used less for leisurley travel 
	and moreso for quicker daily commutes to activities. The heatmap for Hypothesis B provides information on certain station pairs having higher traffic than others at certain hours of the day. 
	This would imply that, following the observation made through Hypothesis A, that there is more demand for certain stations at peak hours during the day. The final visualization, a line graph for 
	Hypothesis C, suggests that ridership during the weekday is substantially higher than during the weekend. This would enforce the fact that CitiBike is used primarily for commuting. Which means that
	there is an imbalanced amount of traffic demanding bike access. Peak hours seem to be 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM on the weekdays in locations such as Vesey Pl & River Terrace to Greenwich St & N Moore St
	and Central Park S & 6 Ave as well as Perishing Square North.

Actionable Recommendations for NYC DOT

    1. Optimizing distribution of bikes during certain days and times of days: Sincere there is a clearer pattern of bike usage trends through this analysis, ensuring more bikes are available during 
	busier hours/days would allow users to have a smoother experience using CitiBike and prevent potential points of frustration. 
	
	2. Strategize based on user type: Since it has been established that customers and subscribers seem to have varying needs when it comes to using CitiBike, distinguishing when bikes are available 
	for either group is important. For subscribers, ensuring the quality of their experience during their commute is reliable. For customers, engaging in partnerships or incentives that motivate them 
	to use the service is a viable option. 
	
	3. Expand on targetting Customers and those who want a more leisure traveling experience: Since the observation of Hypothesis C indicates that weekends have less CitiBike use, it can be inferred 
	that these consumers would like a more leisure travel experience. In this case, offering incentives such as bike passes or offers related to popular sites in the area could motivate customers
	to use CitiBike during that time. Partnerships with tourism or vacation agencies is a potential option to boost interest.
