Station Imbalance:
Data analysis revealed a strong directional imbalance in Citi Bike usage during weekday rush hours. Certain routesshow thousands more trips in one direction (morning inbound, evening outbound). This imbalance suggests operational inefficiency, where some stations face shortages while others have an excess of bikes during critical commuting windows.

Trip Duration Differences by User Type:
Subscribers take much shorter trips (around 13 minutes on average) compared to casual Customers (around 35 minutes). This distinction highlights two major use cases — Subscribers rely on Citi Bike for quick, daily commutes, while Customers treat it as a leisure or sightseeing option. Understanding this behavioral divide can guide pricing, membership models, and marketing strategies.

Peak Demand Patterns:
The busiest hours across the system occur between 7–9 AM and 5–7 PM on weekdays, especially around major employment hubs such as Pershing Square North and 8 Ave & W 31 St. This confirms Citi Bike’s strong alignment with commuter behavior and reveals where and when resource allocation (like dock expansion or rebalancing) can have the most impact.

Actionable Recommendations

1. Intelligent Bike Rebalancing:
Use predictive analytics to proactively redistribute bikes between high-imbalance station pairs before and after peak hours. This ensures consistent bike availability in the morning and evening rush, minimizing customer frustration and improving operational efficiency.

2. Targeted Pricing & Engagement Strategy:
Develop flexible plans that reflect different rider behaviors — such as short-ride commuter bundles for Subscribers and extended-ride day passes for tourists. This personalization can increase satisfaction while improving overall system utilization.

3. Capacity & Infrastructure Optimization:
Expand dock capacity and add overflow or “pop-up” stations in high-demand areas during peak times. Pair this with coordination with NYC DOT street planning to enhance protected bike lanes leading to top commuter stations.

4. Enhanced Data Governance:
Continue improving data quality and completeness, particularly for missing station or demographic data. More accurate data collection will allow for stronger forecasting, fairer accessibility assessments, and better long-term planning.
