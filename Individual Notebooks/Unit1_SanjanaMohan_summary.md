Findings

Through the EDA, several patterns emerged. First, there was a clear gender imbalance, with male riders accounting for a considerably higher share of total trips. However, the presence of unknown and missing values suggests that this result should be interpreted with a grain of salt and could signal underlying issues in data completeness or demographic accessibility.

Second, there was a distinct difference in trip behaviour by user type. Customers tended to take longer trips on average, while subscribers made more frequent but shorter trips. This most likely reflects differences in motivation and familiarity… subscribers use the service regularly and efficiently, while casual customers aim to make the most out of each paid ride. On the other hand, through my looker studio dashboard analysis of the KPIs, we see that on average, subscribers make significantly more number of trips when compared to casual customers.

Lastly, the popularity of certain station pairings and time periods stood out. A small subset of routes contributed disproportionately to total rides, particularly during peak commuting hours (7–9 AM and 6–7 PM). These findings highlight both demand concentration and potential areas where citi bike rebalancing efforts are most necessary.

What Changed After Validation

After validating the data and reviewing null values, I recognized the extent to which missing or incomplete fields affected reliability, particularly in gender, user type and station data. I refined my interpretations accordingly, focusing on trends that were consistently supported across multiple variables instead of drawing conclusions from incomplete subsets. This validation process reinforced the importance of data integrity when generating operational insights and highlighted where NYC DOT could strengthen their data collection methods.

What I Propose

Based on these findings, I propose a few targeted actions. First, develop gender-inclusive marketing and safety campaigns to attract more female riders and reduce perceived barriers to participation. I also propose more inclusivity across both genders as well as age groups, making the process more accessible for older and younger age groups outside of the 20 to 50 years range. Second, implement proactive rebalancing strategies informed by real-time usage data from high-traffic routes and times to prevent bike shortages. Third, improve data accuracy and completeness by standardising collection processes and reducing null entries in demographic and station records. Finally, offering subscriber incentives for casual users could build loyalty and smooth usage patterns throughout the day.
