Insights:

Gender Imbalance: From the output above, we can determine that males tend to make more trips using citi bikes when compared to females. We should take this finding with a grain of salt due to the existance of unknown values and missing data. This could be an area to look into further to determin why this difference exists.

Difference in trip distances by User Type: According to our findings above, customers seem to take loger trips on average when compared to subscribers. This might be because when customers do choose to pay to make a trip using citibike, they want to make the most out of it and therefore, use it longer while subscribers, since they use the service more often, do not feel the pressure to prolong their trip.

Popular Stations: A relatively small number of station pairings make up a large volume of trips. This hints at key routes that are popular in demand and might require more frequent bike rebalancing to ensure smooth processes. we should also take into account the large volume of missing data while interpreting this finding.

Popular Times: The most popular times that the citi bikes are being used according to the data is from 7 to 9 am and from 6 to 7 pm. This makes sense as these are the usual timings that children go to school and that office workers go to and come back from their offices.

Actionable Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing Campaigns: NYC DOT might want to focus on marketing campaigns that help make their services feel more accessible and safe for more female riders as well to adress the gender imbalance in terms of ridership.

Proactive citi bike rebalancing: Use the information collected regarding the most popular stations and times to actively rebalance bikes in these stations to avoid customer congestion. This will enable citibikes to be more readily availiable to all customers who want to use them.

Collect more accurate and usable data: Find a way to minimize and account for missing and null values to make the data more usable.

Incentives for Subscribers: Provide more compelling incentives for casual customers to become subscribers to promote brand loyalty and reduce the churn rate.
