What I Found:

New York Cityâ€™s official bike sharing program, CitiBike, has seen growth throughout 2013-2016. The program experienced its greatest increase in yearly number of trips between 2013 and 2014, when it increased over 60% from around 5 million to 8 million trips. They now facilitate over 10 million bike trips each year! The average trip duration is 15.5 minutes. 

In order to maximize customer reach, it is critical that CitiBike ensure enough bikes are stocked in the most popular locations, possibly shuffling bikes between common ending and beginning stations. The station with the largest net change in bikes (number of bikes left there by a customer ending a trip - number of bikes departed by customers starting a trip) is W 33 St & 7 Ave with a net change of 27,421 bikes! The top 7 stations all have a net change of over 10,000 bikes.  

The most popular route both starts and ends at the Central Park S & 6 Ave station [station 2006]. Most customers on this route are between 20-40 years of age, and take between 25-45 minute trip. However, both these distributions are skewed left, with a significant portion of customers between the ages of 40-60 and taking trips from 45-75 minutes long. 

What Changed:

After validation, I discovered more accurate representations of the ages of CitiBike riders. Most of the oldest riders enjoying popular routes are between the ages of 70-80. 

What I Propose:

I recommend that CitiBike should focus advertising efforts toward the female demographic, since the majority of their customers are male.
Also, the need to ensure the appropriate number of bikes are stocked at each of their stations, taking into account the most popular routes and an imbalance created by different popular start stations and end stations (bikes being deposited in one place and needed to meet demand in another).
