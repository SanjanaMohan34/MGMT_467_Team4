Exact Tasks: For this project, I utilized the team's Kaggle dataset and focused on preprocessing and preparing the data to be loaded into GCP. I created a bucket that would support the process of
moving data across to GCP. Additionally, I utilized the newly cleaned data in order to build baseline Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K Means models. I built a slide deck for the demo
and uploaded the recorded demo to YouTube.

What I Learnt: This process although long and something I was initially unfamiliar with helped me explore beyond batch data to invest in streaming data. This real time data and the collection of it
through an API was a really valuable experience that I can take forward in my future endeavors. I hope to utilize these skills and take into consideration what can be done for future projects and
potentially expand on my knowledge further!
