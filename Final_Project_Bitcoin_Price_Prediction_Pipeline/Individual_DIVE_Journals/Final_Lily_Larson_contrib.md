Set up the CoinCap API to ingest current price information for Bitcoin and other cyrptocurreny assets, then created a pipeline that uploads the most current price for Bitcoin to a GCP BigQuery table. Also used the API to batch ingest historical Bitcoin price data into a BQ table in order to use BQML models and build an interaction plotly chart showing historical price for the last year. 

*Lessons Learned*
I struggled getting the API call to function correctly and to ensure that the data I was capturing contained the information I wanted. I learned the importance of being careful with API version history and using API keys for extra security. It is crucial to be thorough and fact-checking each step of your process.
